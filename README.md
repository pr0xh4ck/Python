 ### basic 
 
 - Q 1: What is Python ?

```
- Dynamic, Interpreted, Object-Oriented and high-level programing language. 
- Enables cross-platform rapid prototyping and scripting.
- Relatively simple, easy to learn syntax.
- General purpose and versatile with a mature standard library.
- Extensible, actively used with a large community.

```
 
- Q 2: Why learn Pyton as a hacker ?

```
- Understand how scripts of proof of concepts work.
- Debug, modify and run scripts or proof of concepts.
- Create your own script of proof of concepts.
- Easy & first programing language of beginners.
- Understanding how an application could work makes it easier to anticipate how it could break.

```
 
 - Q 3: Python2 vs Python3

```
- Python2 is no longer under development but people still use it
- Python2 code will(mostly) not run in a Python3 environment
- Python3 stores strings as unicode by default(not ASCII)
- If you don't know to run a script, try both or try to print
- If you have a choice - use Python3(Python2 is end of life)
