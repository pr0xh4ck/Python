 ### basic 
 
 - Q 1: What is Python ?

```
- Dynamic, Interpreted, Object-Oriented and high-level programing language. 
- Enables cross-platform rapid prototyping and scripting.
- Relatively simple, easy to learn syntax.
- General purpose and versatile with a mature standard library.
- Extensible, actively used with a large community.

```
 
- Q 2: Why learn Pyton as a hacker ?

```
- Understand how scripts of proof of concepts work.
- Debug, modify and run scripts or proof of concepts.
- Create your own script of proof of concepts.
- Easy & first programing language of beginners.
- Understanding how an application could work makes it easier to anticipate how it could break.

```
 
 - Q 3: Python2 vs Python3

```
- Python2 is no longer under development but people still use it
- Python2 code will(mostly) not run in a Python3 environment
- Python3 stores strings as unicode by default(not ASCII)
- If you don't know to run a script, try both or try to print
- If you have a choice - use Python3(Python2 is end of life)
```
 
 
 
 
 ### variables
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ### data-types
```
Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
```
### example
```
x = "Hello World"	str	
x = 20	int	
x = 20.5	float	
x = 1j	complex	
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	list	
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	tuple	
x = range(6)	range	
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	dict	
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	set	
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})	frozenset	
x = True	bool	
x = b"Hello"	bytes	
x = bytearray(5)	bytearray	
x = memoryview(bytes(5))	memoryview
